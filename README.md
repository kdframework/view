This is a part of `KDFramework` that exports the evented, templated, and diffable `KDView` class.

## KDView

`KDView` is the `base` view class that can emit events, use templates, and can manage it's own state transitions.

## Motivation

Main idea of having a document-oriented view framework is developing interactive, and diffable views that has extra abilities that over regular `kdf-dom/view-node`.
